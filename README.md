This is a repository created during the online course [**"Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments"**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems/) offered by the University of Colorado Boulder and published on the [Coursera](http://coursera.com) learning platform.

This course is focused on giving a real world coding experience and hands on project work with ARM based Microcontrollers. I learned how to implement software configuration management and develop embedded software applications. Course assignments include creating a build system using the GNU Toolchain GCC, using Git version control, and developing software in Linux on a Virtual Machine. The course concludes with a project where I created my own build system and firmware that can manipulate memory.

The course is divided into four modules:
* Embedded System Development Components
* Compilation with GCC and GNU Make
* Memory Types, Segments and Management
* Course Final Assessment
